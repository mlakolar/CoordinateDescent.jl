Solve the lasso

    minimize  ‖y - β₀ - Xβ‖² / (2n) + λ ∑ⱼ ωⱼ |βⱼ|

by coordinate descent. The intercept `β₀` is not penalized, and it is zero
unless `intercept` is true. In the first form the loadings are `ωⱼ = 1`, or
with `standardize_x` the standard deviations `sqrt(∑ᵢ (Xᵢⱼ - x̄ⱼ)² / n)` of the
columns, with `x̄ⱼ` the column mean when `intercept` is true and zero
otherwise; the coefficients are on the scale of the data either way. Returns a
[`LassoSolution`](@ref) whose `σ` is the sample standard deviation of the
residuals.

The keyword arguments `kwargs` are fields of [`CDOptions`](@ref) that replace
those of `options`, as in `lasso(X, y, λ; max_iter=10_000, opt_tol=1e-8)`, and
the random order of coordinate descent is drawn from `rng`.

`X` can be any matrix and `y` any vector. A `Matrix`, or a view of a range of
its rows or of some of its columns, is read in place. A `SparseMatrixCSC` stays
sparse; coordinate descent still reads its columns entry by entry, so for now
it is slower than the dense matrix. Any other matrix, such as a transpose or a
view of selected rows, is copied once into a `Matrix` (a `SparseMatrixCSC` if
it is sparse). The same holds for every solver of this package.

With `gram = true`, coordinate descent works on the Gram matrix of the
(centered) columns, `A = X'X / n`, instead of the residuals. Each coordinate
step then costs `O(p)` instead of `O(n)`, after `O(np²)` operations and `p²`
numbers of memory to form `A`. The loss, the stopping rule and so the
solution are the same, to the tolerance. Forming `A` pays off over the many
passes of a path when `n ≥ p`, but rarely at one `λ`. The default,
`gram = :auto`, uses it for [`LassoPath`](@ref) on a dense `X` with `n ≥ p`
and `p ≤ $(_GRAM_PMAX)`, and never at one `λ`.

With observation `weights` `w` (nonnegative, with a positive sum) and an
`offset` `o`, the loss is

    ∑ᵢ wᵢ (yᵢ - oᵢ - β₀ - Xᵢ'β)² / (2 ∑ᵢ wᵢ).

Dividing by `∑ᵢ wᵢ` follows glmnet: `λ` means the same with and without weights,
unit weights give the unweighted fit, integer weights the fit of replicated
rows, and zero weights leave observations out. The intercept, the loadings of
`standardize_x` (`sqrt(∑ᵢ wᵢ (Xᵢⱼ - x̄ⱼ)² / ∑ᵢ wᵢ)`) and the Gram matrix are
weighted as well. The residuals are `y - o - β₀ - Xβ`, and with weights `σ` is
their weighted root mean square, `sqrt(∑ᵢ wᵢ rᵢ² / ∑ᵢ wᵢ)`.

# Other penalties

`alpha < 1` gives glmnet's elastic net, `λ (α ∑ⱼ |βⱼ| + (1 - α) ‖β‖² / 2)`,
for `0 < α ≤ 1`. `penalty` gives another penalty of ProximalBase whose level
`λ` replaces: `NormL1(1, w)` and `NormL1Nonneg(1, w)` (the lasso and the
nonnegative lasso with weights `w`), `ElasticNet(1, λ2, w)` (`λ ∑ⱼ wⱼ|βⱼ| +
λ2 ‖β‖²/2`, with `λ2` fixed), `Scaled(ElasticNet(α, 1 - α, w), 1)` (the elastic
net with weights on its ℓ1 part), and the nonconvex `MCP(1, a)`, `SCAD(1, a)`,
`CappedL1(1, a)` (`λ min(|βⱼ|, a)`, the capped ℓ1 penalty of T. Zhang, 2010,
and the truncated ℓ1 penalty of Shen, Pan and Zhu, 2012) and `LogPenalty(1, ε)`
(`λ log(1 + |βⱼ|/ε)`), whose parameters are kept. The level of the penalty given is not used: `MCP(1, 3)` means "MCP with
`a = 3`".

`alpha` solves the objective of glmnet's documentation. glmnet's gaussian
family scales `y` to unit standard deviation internally, which divides the
ridge part by `sd(y)`, the population standard deviation of `y` (weighted
with weights). So glmnet's solutions are those of
`penalty = Scaled(ElasticNet(α, (1 - α) / sd(y)), 1)`, and they equal those of
`alpha` when `sd(y) = 1`.

With `standardize_x`, the penalty applies to the coefficients of the standardized
columns `X[:, j] / sⱼ`, `sⱼ` their standard deviations, as in glmnet and ncvreg;
the coefficients returned are those of the columns of `X`. For the ℓ1 norm this
is the same as the loadings `ωⱼ = sⱼ`, which is how it is computed. For the
other penalties `X` is divided by `s` once (a copy), and `s` is stored as the
solution's `scales`.

A nonconvex penalty has local solutions, and the one found depends on the
algorithm and the starting point. As in ncvreg, MCP and SCAD are computed by
exact coordinate steps along `options.num_steps` levels from `λmax`, the
smallest level with a zero solution, down to `λ`, each solved to the tolerance
and warm started from the previous one; `num_steps = 0` solves at `λ` from zero.
Use [`LassoPath`](@ref) for the solutions at many levels. With `options.warm_start`
false, a convex penalty other than the ℓ1 norm is also solved along such a path.

The exact steps need each coordinate problem to be convex: `a vⱼ > 1` for MCP
and `(a - 1) vⱼ > 1` for SCAD, where `vⱼ` is the curvature of the loss along
column `j`, its mean square `∑ᵢ (Xᵢⱼ - x̄ⱼ)² / n` (centered with an intercept,
weighted with weights, and of the standardized column with `standardize_x`). The
path throws an `ArgumentError` when a column fails it, since the step could
then leave zero where the test of `λmax` and screening says that zero is
optimal. With `standardize_x`, `vⱼ = 1`, so ncvreg's conditions `a > 1` and
`a > 2` suffice; without it, a column of variance at most `1/a` fails. Take
`standardize_x = true`, a larger `a`, or `lla`.

`lla` computes a nonconvex penalty by local linear approximation (LLA, or
reweighted ℓ1) instead: `lla = LLA(; stages = 2, tol = 1e-12, start = :lasso)`
(ProximalSolvers' `LLA`, exported) solves a sequence of weighted lassos with the
weights `pⱼ′(|βⱼ|)/λ` at the previous solution, each a convex problem, by the
coordinate descent of `options`; the `inner` solver of the `LLA` given is not
used. From zero the first stage is the lasso. The stages stop after `stages`, or
once the weights change by at most `tol`, relative to the largest one.
- `LLA()`, two stages, is the two-step estimator of Fan, Xue and Zou (2014);
  with MCP and SCAD it has no condition on `a`.
- `LLA(; stages = 100)` iterates until the weights stop changing, as the
  multi-stage convex relaxation of T. Zhang (2010), the difference of convex
  functions of Shen, Pan and Zhu (2012, glmtlp's `"tlp"`) and the reweighted ℓ1
  of Candès, Wakin and Boyd (2008). `CappedL1` and `LogPenalty` have no exact
  path and use it when `lla` is `nothing`.
- With `start = :lasso` the stages at `λ` start from the lasso at `λ`, as in the
  papers; with `start = :previous` they start from the solution at the previous
  level of a path of `options.num_steps` levels from `λmax`, as ncpen does.

`lla` does not take bounds (`lower`, `upper`), and it applies to these four
penalties only. With `lla`, `converged` says whether coordinate descent
converged in every stage.

# Bounds

`lower` and `upper` bound the coefficients, `lower ≤ β ≤ upper`, as glmnet's
`lower.limits` and `upper.limits` do: each is a number or a vector with a bound
per coefficient, and zero must be feasible, `lower ≤ 0 ≤ upper`. For example,
`lower = 0` gives the nonnegative lasso, and `upper = 0` with `lower = 0` for a
coefficient keeps it at zero. The intercept is not bounded. The penalty becomes
`Constrained(g, IndBox(l, u))`, which keeps coordinate descent separable, and
λmax and screening use only the directions the bounds allow, so that λmax of
the nonnegative lasso is `maxⱼ (Xⱼ'y / n)₊ / ωⱼ`. With `standardize_x` and a
penalty other than the ℓ1 norm, which applies to `s .* β`, the bounds of the
stored penalty are `s .* lower` and `s .* upper`. Bounds work with every
penalty above, in `lasso`, [`LassoPath`](@ref), [`adaptive_lasso`](@ref)
(through its keywords), [`CVLassoPath`](@ref) and [`glm_lasso`](@ref).

by coordinate descent, with an unpenalized intercept `β₀` that is zero unless
`intercept` is true. In the first form the loadings are the standard deviations
`ωⱼ = sqrt(∑ᵢ (Xᵢⱼ - x̄ⱼ)² / n)` of the columns when `standardize_x` is true
(centered only with an intercept) and `ωⱼ = 1` otherwise. The optimal `λ`
does not depend on the noise level. Returns a [`LassoSolution`](@ref) whose
`σ` is the sample standard deviation of the residuals. The keyword arguments
`kwargs`, `gram` and `rng` are as for [`lasso`](@ref); on the Gram matrix the
loss is the square root of a quadratic (as in [`CDSqrtQuadraticLoss`](@ref)).
With observation `weights` `w` and an `offset` `o`, the loss is the weighted
norm `sqrt(∑ᵢ wᵢ (yᵢ - oᵢ - β₀ - Xᵢ'β)²)`, the loadings are weighted as in
[`lasso`](@ref), and `σ` is the weighted root mean square of the residuals.

Scaled lasso of Sun and Zhang (2012), which estimates the coefficients and the
noise level jointly:

    minimize  ‖y - β₀ - Xβ‖² / (2nσ) + σ/2 + λ ∑ⱼ ωⱼ |βⱼ|   over β and σ > 0.

The intercept `β₀` is not penalized, and it is zero unless `intercept` is true.
The minimum over `σ` is at `σ̂ = ‖y - β₀ - Xβ‖ / √n`, so `β̂` solves the
square-root lasso of Belloni, Chernozhukov and Wang (2011),

    minimize  ‖y - β₀ - Xβ‖ / √n + λ ∑ⱼ ωⱼ |βⱼ|,

which one run of coordinate descent solves (on [`CDSqrtLassoLoss`](@ref), with
the penalty level `√n λ`), with the options `options.options_cd`; the other
fields of [`IterLassoOptions`](@ref) are not used. Coordinate descent starts
from and overwrites `x` (unless `options.options_cd.warm_start` is false).
Returns a [`LassoSolution`](@ref) whose `σ` is `σ̂`, and whose penalty is that of
the lasso that `β̂` solves, `NormL1(λσ̂, ω)`.

The third form solves the same problem from sufficient statistics: with the
loss [`CDSqrtQuadraticLoss`](@ref)`(A, b, c)`, `A = X'X/n`, `b = -X'y/n` and
`c = y'y/n`, it needs neither `X` nor `y`, and a coordinate update costs `O(p)`
instead of `O(n)`. With `A = S`, `b = -S[:, j]`, `c = S[j, j]` and `ω[j] = Inf`
it is the scaled lasso of variable `j` on the others from their covariance
matrix `S`, as in the precision matrix estimator of Sun and Zhang (2013); for
all the variables, check `S` once and build the losses with `check = false`.
Its solution has no residuals (an empty vector) and no intercept.

The keyword arguments `kwargs` are fields of the options that replace those of
`options` (of [`IterLassoOptions`](@ref) in the first two forms, of
[`CDOptions`](@ref) in the third), and the random order of coordinate descent
is drawn from `rng`. With observation `weights` `w` and an `offset` `o`, the
loss is `∑ᵢ wᵢ rᵢ² / (2σ ∑ᵢ wᵢ) + σ/2` for the residuals `r = y - o - β₀ - Xβ`,
so that `σ̂ = sqrt(∑ᵢ wᵢ rᵢ² / ∑ᵢ wᵢ)`.

Before version 0.6.1, `scaled_lasso!` alternated lasso fits with updates of `σ̂`
until the relative change of `σ̂` was below `options.opt_tol` (by default 1e-2),
which stopped short of the solution and solved a lasso at every iteration.

    feasible_lasso!(x, X, y, λ0, options=IterLassoOptions(); intercept=false, rng=Random.default_rng(), kwargs...)

Heteroscedasticity-robust lasso of Belloni, Chen, Chernozhukov and Hansen
(2012), which uses data-driven penalty loadings. It alternates between the
lasso

    β̂ = argmin  ‖y - β₀ - Xβ‖² / (2n) + λ0 ∑ⱼ Γⱼ |βⱼ|

and the update of the loadings `Γⱼ = sqrt(∑ᵢ (Xᵢⱼ - x̄ⱼ)² rᵢ² / n)` from the
residuals `r = y - β̂₀ - Xβ̂`, until the relative change in `Γ` is below
`options.opt_tol` (by `ProximalSolvers.reweight!`), or warns after
`options.max_iter` iterations. With `max_iter = 0` there is no update: `x` is
left as the initial procedure leaves it, the loadings are those of its
residuals, and `converged` is false, without a warning. The intercept `β₀` is
not penalized; it and the column means `x̄ⱼ` are zero unless `intercept` is
true.

The initial residuals are chosen by `options.init_procedure` (see
[`IterLassoOptions`](@ref)); with `:InitStd` they come from a lasso with
penalty `λ0 σinit ∑ⱼ sⱼ |βⱼ|`, `sⱼ = sqrt(∑ᵢ (Xᵢⱼ - x̄ⱼ)² / n)`. Coordinate descent
starts from and overwrites `x`, and each lasso fit is warm started from the
previous one. Returns a [`LassoSolution`](@ref) whose `penalty.w` holds the
loadings of the last fit and whose `σ` is the sample standard deviation of the
residuals. The keyword arguments `kwargs` are fields of
[`IterLassoOptions`](@ref) that replace those of `options`, as in
`feasible_lasso!(x, X, y, λ0; max_iter=50)`, and the random order of coordinate
descent is drawn from `rng`.

              upper=Inf, rng=Random.default_rng(), kwargs...)
    LassoPath(X, y, options=CDOptions(); nλ=100, λminratio, kwargs...)

Lasso solutions `β0path[k]` and `βpath[k]` of

    minimize  ‖y - β₀ - Xβ‖² / (2n) + λpath[k] ∑ⱼ ωⱼ |βⱼ|

along a decreasing sequence `λpath`, each one warm started from the previous
solution, by `ProximalSolvers.solve_path`. The intercept `β₀` is not penalized, and it is zero unless
`intercept` is true. The loadings are the standard deviations
`ωⱼ = sqrt(∑ᵢ (Xᵢⱼ - x̄ⱼ)² / n)` of the columns when `standardize_x` is true
(centered only with an intercept) and `ωⱼ = 1` otherwise.

Without `λpath`, the path has `nλ` values spaced evenly on the log scale from
`λmax`, the smallest value whose solution is zero, down to `λminratio ⋅ λmax`;
`λminratio` defaults to `0.01` when `X` has more columns than rows and to
`1e-4` otherwise. The first value is `λmax` times `1 + √eps`, so that rounding
cannot make the first solution nonzero.

With `screening`, each λ is solved first over the coordinates kept by the
sequential strong rule of Tibshirani et al. (2012), and the optimality
conditions of the others are checked afterwards; coordinates that violate them
are added and the problem solved again. `kkt_checks[k]` is the number of checks
at `λpath[k]`: one when the rule kept every coordinate it should have, zero
without screening. When `options.warm_start` is false, each value is solved
from zero along its own path of `options.num_steps` levels, without screening.

The path stops early, after the first solution with more than `max_hat_s`
nonzero coefficients; the returned `λpath` then contains only the values that
were solved for. The solutions are stored as `SparseVector`s, so a path takes
memory proportional to the number of nonzero coefficients. `iterations[k]` and
`converged[k]` are the passes of coordinate descent at `λpath[k]` and whether it
met its stopping rule. See also [`refit_lasso_path`](@ref).

The keyword arguments `kwargs` that are not listed are fields of
[`CDOptions`](@ref) that replace those of `options`, and the random order of
coordinate descent is drawn from `rng`. With `gram`, the path is solved on the
Gram matrix of the columns, and with `weights` and `offset` the loss is the
weighted one, as described for [`lasso`](@ref); `λmax` and the loadings are
weighted too. `fit(LassoPath, X, y, ...)` is the same
as `LassoPath(X, y, ...)`. The functions of StatsAPI apply to the path:
[`coef`](@ref), [`predict`](@ref) and [`nobs`](@ref); `nobs` is the number of
observations, also stored as `nobs`.

`alpha` and `penalty` give the elastic net and other penalties, as for
[`lasso`](@ref): `LassoPath(X, y; alpha=0.5)` is glmnet's elastic-net path at
a fixed `α`, whose `λmax` is that of the lasso divided by `α`, and
`LassoPath(X, y; penalty=MCP(1, 3))` the path of ncvreg, on standardized
columns with `standardize_x`. Along a path of a nonconvex penalty, each solution
is the local one reached from the previous solution, starting from zero at
`λmax`. Without `standardize_x`, the exact steps of MCP and SCAD need the
condition on `a` described for [`lasso`](@ref). `lla` computes the path by
local linear approximation, as described there. With `penalty =
CappedL1(1, a)` and `intercept = true` (and `lla = nothing`, which then means
`LLA(; stages = 100)`) it is the path of glmtlp's `"tlp"` with `tau = a`, with
`standardize_x` as glmtlp's `standardize`. With `lla = LLA(; stages = 1000,
start = :previous)`, `standardize_x = false` and `intercept = true`, the paths
of MCP, SCAD and `CappedL1` are those of ncpen with `x.standardize = FALSE`
(ncpen's own standardization differs from `standardize_x`). Its `λmax` is that
of the first stage, the lasso with the weights `pⱼ′(0)/λ`. `penalty` holds the penalty at level one, `NormL1(1, ω)` for the lasso
with loadings `ω`; the solution at `λpath[k]` minimizes the loss plus that
penalty at level `λpath[k]`, applied to `scales .* β` when `scales` is not
`nothing` (`standardize_x` with a penalty other than the ℓ1 norm). `lower` and
`upper` bound the coefficients, as for [`lasso`](@ref); `penalty` is then
`Constrained(g, IndBox(l, u))`, and `λmax` is the smallest level whose solution
is zero under the bounds.

Consecutive supports along a path differ by a few columns, so the Cholesky
